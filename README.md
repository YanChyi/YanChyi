### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yan Chyi.

I am a project assistant with 2+ years of work experience in researching, gathering, analysing, and interpreting data for the gaming and payment market.
 
I recently completed the [IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/DKNJEE2QG97V) and looking for a job opportunity in the data analytics field.
